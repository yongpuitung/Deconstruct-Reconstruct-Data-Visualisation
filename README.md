# Deconstruct and Reconstruct Data Visualisation Using R

## Overview
In this project, I will deconstruct and reconstruct a "problematic" data visualisation found on the web using R.  The goal is to pinpoint any issues and rectify them, ensuring that the data visualization can effectively address a practical question.

## Motivation
As the quantity of data visualizations on the web continues to grow, it becomes crucial to scrutinize and recognize whether these visualizations may deceive or mislead the public audience. This exercise holds significance for data analysts, who bear the major responsibility of delivering precise visualizations to their audience.

## Dataset
The original data visualisation selected could be found at [this link](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Patent-Grants-by-Country-of-Origin.html).

## Tools Used
In this data visualization project, I employed R and its various packages, including ggplot2, to dissect and amend the flawed visualization.

## Project Objectives
This visualisation aims to identify the top countries granted the most number of patents in different fields of technology in 2021. This information is crucial for recognizing the leading nations in technological innovation. Additionally, the visualisation seeks to facilitate a direct comparison of the number of patent grants between countries. This comparison is crucial for reader to evaluate the roles of different nations in the technological landscape.

This visualisation could potentially educate audience, influence audience’s behavior and decision-making in the following ways:

- Educate Audience about Global Trends
- Guide Investment Decisions
- Influence on Innovation Strategies
 
## Audience

The visualisation is published on “Visual Capitalist” website. It is a digital media company that specializes in creating data visualisation related to economics, finance, technology and global trends. Based on the website content and style, the designer is likely targeting individuals who are interested in understanding certain issues via data-driven visualisation. This includes

- Students
- Professionals in Related Fields
- Investors
- Business Leaders

Based on the specific article “Which Countries are Granted the Most New Patents?” we chose, the target audience is individuals with an interest in intellectual property, innovation and global economic trends. This includes

- Inventors
- Entrepreneurs
- Investors
- Policymakers
- Professionals in fields related to intellectual property law, technology and innovation

Based on the tone of the visualisation and the related article, it is informative and analytical. It presents data and facts about patent grants across different countries and technological fields, providing insights into the global landscape of innovation and intellectual property.

The article’s detailed analysis and use of specific data points suggest that it is designed for target audience with a keen interest in patents, intellectual property and technology trends. For example, it is likely to be professionals, researchers, policymakers, investors and individuals who are interested in innovation and intellectual property.

## Critique
The visualisation chosen had the following three main issues:
- Issue 1: Data Integrity (Missing Data)
- Issue 2: Perceptual Issue
- Issue 3: Failure to Answer a Practical Question

## Reconstruction

I have reconstructed the following plot which helps fix the main issues.
